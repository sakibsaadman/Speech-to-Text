# 🎤 Speech to Text NLP Project

This project demonstrates how to convert speech audio into text using automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques. It leverages powerful pre-trained models from Hugging Face and integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities for analyzing the transcribed text.

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Upload and process `.wav` audio files
- 🧠 Use Hugging Face's `facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h` model for speech recognition
- 📝 View transcribed text from audio
- 📊 Basic text analysis (word count, sentence count, etc.)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets
- `torchaudio` for audio processing
- `IPython.display` for audio playback in the notebook
- `nltk` for basic text analytics

## 📂 File Structure

```
Speech_to_Text_NLP.ipynb     # Main notebook for speech-to-text + NLP
```

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchaudio transformers datasets ipywidgets nltk
   ```

3. Download necessary NLTK packages (if prompted):
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open `Speech_to_Text_NLP.ipynb` and follow the instructions in the cells.

## 🎧 Sample Audio File Format

- Must be `.wav` format
- Clear speech quality preferred
- Mono channel with 16kHz sample rate for best results

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add support for other audio formats
- Enhance text analysis with sentiment and keyword extraction
- Integrate with a UI for easier interaction
